                    On Monday evening, Laiba Ali ’26 trekked toward Murray-Dodge Hall
                    to partake in the Maghrib salah, the fourth of the five daily
                    Islamic prayers to be completed at sunset. Once she arrived at
                    the third floor of Murray-Dodge, where Princeton's official
                    Muslim prayer room is located, Ali observed that several Muslim
                    peers were already performing the sunset prayer right outside
                    their designated space. She had noticed that the prayer room
                    was already at full capacity, but she was not surprised.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    As an officer of the Muslim Student Association (MSA), Ali
                    witnesses overcrowding of the Muslim prayer room daily. "I
                    don’t remember the last time I prayed Maghrib salah in a
                    congregation and we didn’t expand outside the prayer room…Outside 
                    the prayer room, there’s a little bit of space and
                    even then [we'll] often have a second jama'ah (congregational
                    prayer) because we still can’t fit everyone," noted Ali.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The MSA is not the only student religious affinity
                    organization that experiences space constraints for its
                    members. As the Vice President of Princeton Hindu Satsangam
                    (PHS), Princeton University's official Hindu student group,
                    Sharv Dave ’25 expresses some hardships in accessing his
                    group's established prayer area within the Interfaith Prayer
                    Room, located on the third floor of Murray-Dodge Hall near
                    the Muslim prayer space. "Since we share the space with other
                    religions...the timings don't always work out. So, for
                    instance, if the Buddhist students are using the room, then
                    we have to either wait or go at another time," said Dave.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    As Princeton University endeavors to uphold its 
                    "<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/meet-princeton/mission-statement">commitment
                    to welcome, support, and engage students, faculty, and staff
                    with a broad range of backgrounds and experiences</a>," it faces
                    the practical challenges of aligning its physical spaces with
                    the needs of its religious community. According to a survey
                    conducted in the Spring ’23 semester by Princeton's Office of
                    Religious Life, more than 24 different faiths and belief
                    systems are practiced among the university's undergraduate
                    population, which consists of over 5,500 students. Currently,
                    the University provides four official religious affinity
                    spaces – the Center for Jewish Life, the Interfaith and Muslim
                    meditation areas in Murray-Dodge Hall, and the University
                    Chapel – with the expectation that students who do not adhere
                    to Jewish, Muslim, or Christian traditions should practice
                    their faiths within the interfaith prayer area.

                <p> 
                    To provide a clearer picture of how Princeton's current religious 
                    affinity spaces serve its diverse student body, I conducted an in-depth 
                    investigation of these facilities. The examination revealed that the 
                    University Chapel provides only one type of Bible, exclusively in English, 
                    which could limit the accessibility for Christian students with diverse 
                    linguistic backgrounds or denominational affiliations. Furthermore, the 
                    dimensions of the Muslim prayer room measured to be 9'7 by 14'2. 
                    "We have significantly outgrown the space. I think we have up to 
                    400 Muslims and the prayer room holds 15 people at a time,” Ali noted. 
                    Additionally, the slightly bigger Interfaith Prayer Room faces accessibility 
                    challenges for individuals with physical disabilities. "That space is not 
                    accessible. You have to either go up or down a couple of steps of stairs in 
                    order to access that place," Ali added.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    However, additional challenges related to Princeton's religious 
                    affinity spaces extend beyond the scope of that investigation and 
                    previously cited experiences. The Vice President of Natives at 
                    Princeton (NAP), Ixtle Montuffar ’27, recounts several experiences 
                    where sacred artifacts within the Interfaith Prayer Room would be 
                    tampered with. "Some things happened where our belongings, as well 
                    as other shrines or other religious areas, were messed with in a way. 
                    Things would be moved, or they would be covered up," Montuffar said. 
                    Dave, too, shares this concern. "Sometimes each of our things are 
                    placed in different places," he noted. This issue would persist 
                    frequently, compelling Montuffar to eventually cease utilizing 
                    the prayer space. "This would happen...maybe once a week for three 
                    weeks in a row. And that’s when I stopped going...I honestly have 
                    not gone back since those repeated events of someone messing with 
                    that space and all the religions there," added Montuffar. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Montuffar’s decision to discontinue using the Interfaith Prayer Room 
                    due to recurring incidents of tampering raises additional complexities, 
                    particularly regarding the space's suitability for Indigenous students. 
                    Montuffar’s belief system involves the use of incense, a practice regulated 
                    solely within the Interfaith Meditation Room. This regulation poses a conundrum, 
                    as many Indigenous students, including Montuffar, assert the freedom to engage 
                    in prayer rituals in spaces of their choosing.
                </p> 
                <br/>
                <p>
                    However, the regulatory framework surrounding flammable materials 
                    within the Interfaith Meditation Room prompts scrutiny. Dave, representing 
                    a tradition that incorporates flammable substances into its practices, 
                    expresses apprehension regarding potential fire hazards. "We can't always 
                    do stuff that we want to do religiously because we’re afraid of setting 
                    the fire alarm off," explained Dave. 
                </p>
                <br/>   
                <p>
                    Additionally, Dave shares how the Interfaith Prayer Room is sometimes 
                    used for non-religious matters. "I think another big challenge that we 
                    often face is that since it is basically an empty room, it's often used 
                    as a study spot, which I know that a lot of the chaplains have been talking 
                    about how to combat that," said Dave. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The experiences of Muslim students also reveal a distinct set of hurdles. 
                    Murray-Dodge Hall typically closes daily at midnight, preventing many 
                    Muslim students from performing specific prayers in congregation, such as 
                    Fajr, the first of the five Islamic prayers to be completed at sunrise. 
                    As an active member of the MSA, Arika Hassan ’26 shares these concerns. 
                    "There's a lot of morning prayers that happen at 5:00 AM or 4:00 AM sometimes, 
                    so we can't access the building during that time...There are a lot of other 
                    prayers that happen really late into the night, like the Tahajjud 
                    (nightly recitation of the Qur'an) and other Qiyam stuff. So that would 
                    happen at 2:00 or 3:00 AM," said Hassan. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    However, the closure times of Murray-Dodge Hall represent just one aspect 
                    of the challenges faced by religious students; its location proves to be 
                    inconvenient for some. "All of my classes are by the E-Quad and Friend Center. 
                    So, that's a very far walk to make, to go pray and then come back for my classes...
                    For people that live much further away, like down campus, it's even harder for 
                    them to have access to it," noted Ali. Hassan echoes the same barrier. "I feel 
                    that might discourage some people from coming up if they're not already in the 
                    area," said Hassan.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p> 
                    Considering these diverse challenges – from spatial constraints to scheduling 
                    conflicts and the limitations of current facilities in meeting students'
                     needs – there appears to be a consensus among students regarding the need 
                     for more accommodating spaces for religious affinity groups at Princeton. 
                     "Our numbers are very much reaching that level and we need...more than just 
                     one tiny prayer room. We need a floor of a building where we can all fit," 
                     noted Ali.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Hassan further proposed a potential solution. "[Princeton can] work more 
                    with building managers or different buildings on campus to get small prayer 
                    spaces in case someone's all the way in PNI, the Neuroscience building. I can't 
                    think of any communal prayer spaces over there right now. A lot of people tend 
                    to grab a prayer mat, hide under a staircase, and pray. So, I think setting up 
                    small spots like that and making sure it's clean," Hassan explained.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Thus, I embarked on a thorough exploration to identify potential spaces 
                    across campus that could serve as additional prayer and meditation areas. 
                    Most academic buildings are equipped with an abundance of seminar rooms, 
                    conference rooms, and classrooms. Additionally, several buildings house 
                    miscellaneous spaces such as quiet rooms, multipurpose rooms, and large 
                    storage areas. The possibility of converting any one of these existing 
                    spaces could offer a practical solution to the current shortage. Now, 
                    understanding and addressing the needs of Princeton's religious communities 
                    requires thoughtful consideration of each community's needs, so here are 
                    the parameters I utilized in my assessment:
                </p>
                <br/> <br/>
                <p>    
                    <b>Building Metrics</b>

                    <li>
                        <b>Number of Potential Affinity Spaces:</b> 
                        This metric helps in identifying how many spaces within 
                        a building can be designated for religious practices; 
                        it ensures that there are sufficient options available 
                        to accommodate the diverse needs of the student body 
                        without causing congestion or scheduling conflicts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Maximum Capacity of the Biggest Potential Affinity Space Within Each Building:</b>
                        Knowing the capacity of the largest space available is 
                        crucial for organizing larger gatherings and events.

                    This comprehensive investigation of Princeton’s facilities 
                    reveals a significant potential to accommodate various 
                    religious affinity groups. The data, drawn from an extensive 
                    survey of campus buildings, indicates that there are over 
                    300 rooms that could be designated as religious affinity 
                    spaces. These rooms not only meet basic accessibility 
                    requirements—such as door widths suitable for wheelchairs 
                    and the presence of ramps or elevators—but also feature 
                    amenities conducive to religious observances, like adjustable 
                    lighting, exterior windows, and nearby water sources for 
                    ablutions.

                    Thus, the analysis highlights the practicality of 
                    reallocating existing spaces to address the requirements 
                    of Princeton's diverse religious communities. The responsibility 
                    now lies with the University to decide the most effective way 
                    to meet the needs of these groups. "Maybe moving forward, 
                    as we see other permanent spaces for cultural affinity 
                    groups, there will be designated religious spaces in here 
                    as well that will help ease this tension of all these groups 
                    coming in one area," said Montuffar.
